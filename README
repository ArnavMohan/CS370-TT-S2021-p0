--Assignment--
You will be writing a logging library that should work on functions that look like R f(double a, double b).
If you feel like doing more go ahead.
A sample use has been given in tests/test.h but doesn't make much sense.
Please note you only want to log external calls.
Your log can be formatted however you want, but needs to include function name and argument values.
Thus if some function calls another function in the library we don't want to log that information.
See how good your abstraction is and write another test (name it something else).

Part of the assignment is to be able to break apart build systems.
Modify it to compile your logging code.

Correctness is 10% of the grade.
The entirety of the rest of your grade is dependent upon a clear effort to achieve code quality and the answers to the report questions.
You may answer the report questions in the file itself, but scanning a written pdf or latex pdf included in submission are also acceptable if you find that easier.

--Build--

A testcase is provided in test.h, and to add your own testcase, overwrite that file. Other files in that folder will not be run.

To build a test:
	make test

To build the src folder and run all the output:
	make

To remove the executable:
	make clean
